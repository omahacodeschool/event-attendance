In fact, Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook and Co-Founder of LeanIn.org says it will take more than 100 years to reach the progress my daughter and I are looking for in the workforce.</p> <p>This is particularly troubling as in just under 8 years Millennials will make up 75% of the global workforce and Millennial women are seeking out employers with a strong record on equality and diversity. </p> <p>WiTH is hosting a panel discussion on March 21 with AIM and Tech Talent Greater Omaha Chamber to dig deeper on how Omaha is progressing on gender equality, diversity, and inclusion in tech.  If you manage or hire staff, if you are interested in retaining top talent, if you want to know more about advancing your career, or if you are new to the workforce and want to learn more about the local landscape - you will want to attend this lively discussion!</p> <p><b>Panelists:</b></p> <p>Rebecca Stavick Executive Director Do Space: Before assuming the role of Executive Director of Do Space in 2015, Rebecca Stavick earned a Master's of Library and Information Science degree at San Jose State University, and worked for nearly five years in the Omaha Public Library system.
